# 📚 Database – Lab 4  
This repository contains the documentation and visual assets for **Database Lab 4** from the ITI 9-Month Program.

## 📌 Description  
This repo stores all the resources related to Lab 4, including:  
- 📄 PDF files: lab instructions, design documents, relational schema reports, and theoretical materials  
- 🖼️ Images: Entity-Relationship diagrams, normalization illustrations, and other database design visuals  

This is a **documentation-only repository**, so there is no executable code — only diagrams and written material to explain the lab’s concepts and database models.

## 📁 Repository Structure  
```

## 🎯 Objectives of Lab 4  
- Translate ER diagrams into **normalized relational schemas**  
- Explain the normalization process (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, etc.) with examples  
- Document and justify design decisions (primary keys, foreign keys, constraints)  
- Provide visual diagrams and written explanation to communicate database design
